### Assignment C

### Versioning:

 

### Real-time Updates:

Since the backend provides new data every ~500ms, consider using WebSocket connections for real-time updates. This can reduce the need for frequent polling by clients.

### Error Handling:

Implement consistent error handling mechanisms with meaningful error codes and messages. Provide clear instructions to clients on how to resolve common issues.

### Documentation:

Provide comprehensive and up-to-date documentation. Include details about each endpoint, expected request and response formats, and any authentication requirements.

### Mock Data for Testing:
Provide a way for clients to access mock data for testing purposes. This can be useful during development and testing phases.

### Mock Data for Designing Frontend:
Offer sample or mock data for frontend developers to design and develop the user interface even before the backend is fully implemented.

### Feedback Mechanism:
Consider implementing a feedback mechanism where clients can provide feedback on the API. This can help in identifying areas for improvement.

### Sensible Defaults:
When designing the API, consider providing sensible defaults for optional parameters to simplify the usage for clients.

### Versioned Mock Data:
If the mockup of the launch vehicle trajectory is expected to change, consider versioning this mock data so that clients can adapt their handling accordingly.
