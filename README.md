### Assignment C

For the Assignment C here are my some comments on API:

1. First of All i believe we need a well documentation for api struture including details on expected response format, possible error codes, and usage guidelines.

2. We can add some more fields for exapmle timestamps,error  filed with message.

3. We could think about units for velocity, altitude, temperature to avoid confusions.

4. Consider think about security for example we could consider authentication or api key.
